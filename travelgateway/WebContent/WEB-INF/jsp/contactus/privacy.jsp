                	<p>A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a web server and stored on your hard drive. Delightful Travel & Tours uses cookies.

Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.</p>
                	<h5 class="post-title text-darken">IP Addresses & Log Files</h5>
                	<p>IP addresses are collected only to obtain various types of statistics about our web-site, such as the most frequently requested pages and paths followed, as well as other system administration tasks. Log file information, such as an IP address, is not linked to personal information.</p>
                	<h5 class="post-title text-darken">Sharing Information</h5>
                	<p>When you reserve or purchase travel arrangements through Delightful Travel & Tours, we provide some personal information (such as first and last name) to the airline or other third parties involved to ensure the successful fulfillment of your vacation plans. We do not sell individual user names or other private profile information to third parties. Delightful Travel & Tours may hire a third party to act on its behalf for projects such as market research surveys and/or contest-entry processing and will provide information to third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects.

                	<p>This web-site takes every precaution to protect the information of its users. When users submit sensitive information via the web-site, it is protected both online and offline. Credit card transactions are authorized through a credit card processor. All information provided to Delightful Travel & Tours is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt and scramble data before you send it to us. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just surfing. You may also double-check if the address line shows "https:" to make sure that you are currently on a secure page.</p>

                	<p>Delightful Travel & Tours may disclose information if required to do so by law, court order, by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Delightful Travel & Tours or when there is reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.                 </p>
